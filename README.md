# PMG-csv-combiner

This python program, CSV Combiner, will take multiple CSV files as arguments in the command line and then combine all of them if they have the same columns. The output of the new CSV file is through stdout. A new column is added called filename and its purpose is to describe the row of which file it belongs to.
